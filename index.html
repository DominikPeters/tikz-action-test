            <span class="textsc">pgf</span> system. What began as a small

            has now grown to become a full-blown graphics language with a manual
            of over a thousand pages. The wealth of options offered by
            Ti<em>k</em>Z is often daunting to beginners; but fortunately this
            documentation comes with a number of slowly-paced tutorials that
            will teach you almost all you should know about Ti<em>k</em>Z
            without your having to read the rest.
          </p>

          <p>
            I wish to start with the questions &ldquo;What is
            Ti<em>k</em>Z?&rdquo; Basically, it just defines a number of
            <span class="latexlogofont"
              ><span class="latexlogo"
                >T<span class="latexlogosub">e</span>X</span
              ></span
            >
            commands that draw graphics. For example, the code
            <span class="texttt">\tikz \draw (0pt,0pt) -- (20pt,6pt);</span>
            yields the line
            <span class="lateximagesource" id="lateximage-pgfmanual-2"
              ><!--
--><img
                alt="(-tikz-&nbsp;diagram)"
                class="lateximage"
                src="pgfmanual-images/image-2.svg"
                style
            /></span>
            and the code
            <span class="texttt"
              >\tikz \fill[orange] (1ex,1ex) circle (1ex);</span
            >
            yields
            <span class="lateximagesource" id="lateximage-pgfmanual-3"
              ><!--
--><img
                alt="(-tikz-&nbsp;diagram)"
                class="lateximage"
                src="pgfmanual-images/image-3.svg"
                style /></span
            >. In a sense, when you use Ti<em>k</em>Z you &ldquo;program&rdquo;
            your graphics, just as you &ldquo;program&rdquo; your document when
            you use
            <span class="latexlogofont"
              ><span class="latexlogo"
                >T<span class="latexlogosub">e</span>X</span
              ></span
            >. This also explains the name: Ti<em>k</em>Z is a recursive acronym
            in the tradition of &ldquo;<span class="textsc">gnu</span>&rsquo;s
            Not Unix&rdquo; and means &ldquo;Ti<em>k</em>Z ist
            <em>kein</em> Zeichenprogramm&rdquo;, which translates to
            &ldquo;Ti<em>k</em>Z is not a drawing program&rdquo;, cautioning the
            reader as to what to expect. With Ti<em>k</em>Z you get all the
            advantages of the &ldquo;<span class="latexlogofont"
              ><span class="latexlogo"
                >T<span class="latexlogosub">e</span>X</span
              ></span
            >-approach to typesetting&rdquo; for your graphics: quick creation
            of simple graphics, precise positioning, the use of macros, often
            superior typography. You also inherit all the disadvantages: steep
            learning curve, no <span class="textsc">wysiwyg</span>, small
            changes require a long recompilation time, and the code does not
            really &ldquo;show&rdquo; how things will look like.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now that we know what Ti<em>k</em>Z is, what about &ldquo;<span
              class="textsc"
              >pgf</span
            >&rdquo;? As mentioned earlier, Ti<em>k</em>Z started out as a
            project to implement
            <span class="latexlogofont"
              ><span class="latexlogo"
                >T<span class="latexlogosub">e</span>X</span
              ></span
            >
            graphics macros that can be used both with pdf<span
              class="latexlogofont"
              ><span class="latexlogo"
                >L<span class="latexlogosup">a</span>T<span class="latexlogosub"
                  >e</span
                >X</span
              ></span
            >
            and also with the classical (PostScript-based)
            <span class="latexlogofont"
              ><span class="latexlogo"
                >L<span class="latexlogosup">a</span>T<span class="latexlogosub"
                  >e</span
                >X</span
              ></span
            >. In other words, I wanted to implement a &ldquo;portable graphics
            format&rdquo; for
            <span class="latexlogofont"
              ><span class="latexlogo"
                >T<span class="latexlogosub">e</span>X</span
              ></span
            >
            &ndash; hence the name <span class="textsc">pgf</span>. These early
            macros are still around and they form the &ldquo;basic layer&rdquo;
            of the system described in this manual, but most of the interaction
            an author has theses days is with Ti<em>k</em>Z &ndash; which has
            become a whole language of its own.
          </p>
          <h5 id="autosec-14">
            <span class="sectionnumber" id="sec-1.1">1.1&emsp;</span>The Layers
            Below Ti<em>k</em>Z<a class="anchor-link" href="#sec-1.1">&para;</a>
          </h5>
          <a id="pgfmanual-autopage-14"></a>

          <p>
            It turns out that there are actually <em>two</em> layers below
            Ti<em>k</em>Z:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>System layer:</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                This layer provides a complete abstraction of what is going on
                &ldquo;in the driver&rdquo;. The driver is a program like
                <span class="texttt">dvips</span> or
                <span class="texttt">dvipdfm</span> that takes a
                <span class="texttt">.dvi</span> file as input and generates a
                <span class="texttt">.ps</span> or a
                <span class="texttt">.pdf</span> file. (The
                <span class="texttt">pdftex</span> program also counts as a
                driver, even though it does not take a
                <span class="texttt">.dvi</span> file as input. Never mind.)
                Each driver has its own syntax for the generation of graphics,
                causing headaches to everyone who wants to create graphics in a
                portable way. <span class="textsc">pgf</span>&rsquo;s system
                layer &ldquo;abstracts away&rdquo; these differences. For
                example, the system command
                <span class="texttt">\pgfsys@lineto{10pt}{10pt}</span> extends
                the current path to the coordinate (10pt, 10pt) of the current
                <span class="texttt">{pgfpicture}</span>. Depending on whether
                <span class="texttt">dvips</span>,
                <span class="texttt">dvipdfm</span>, or
                <span class="texttt">pdftex</span> is used to process the
                document, the system command will be converted to different
                <span class="texttt">\special</span> commands. The system layer
                is as &ldquo;minimalistic&rdquo; as possible since each
                additional command makes it more work to port
                <span class="textsc">pgf</span> to a new driver.
              </p>
              <p>As a user, you will not use the system layer directly.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Basic layer:</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                The basic layer provides a set of basic commands that allow you
                to produce complex graphics in a much easier manner than by
                using the system layer directly. For example, the system layer
                provides no commands for creating circles since circles can be
                composed from the more basic B&eacute;zier curves (well,
                almost). However, as a user you will want to have a simple
                command to create circles (at least I do) instead of having to
                write down half a page of B&eacute;zier curve support
                coordinates. Thus, the basic layer provides a command
                <span class="texttt">\pgfpathcircle</span> that generates the
                necessary curve coordinates for you.
              </p>
              <p>
                The basic layer consists of a <em>core</em>, which consists of
                several interdependent packages that can only be loaded
                <em>en bloc</em>, and additional <em>modules</em> that extend
                the core by more special-purpose commands like node management
                or a plotting interface. For instance, the
                <span class="textsc">beamer</span> package uses only the core
                and not, say, the <span class="texttt">shapes</span> modules.
              </p>
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <p>
            In theory, Ti<em>k</em>Z itself is just one of several possible
            &ldquo;frontends&rdquo;. which are sets of commands or a special
            syntax that makes using the basic layer easier. A problem with
            directly using the basic layer is that code written for this layer
            is often too &ldquo;verbose&rdquo;. For example, to draw a simple
            triangle, you may need as many as five commands when using the basic
            layer: One for beginning a path at the first corner of the triangle,
            one for extending the path to the second corner, one for going to
            the third, one for closing the path, and one for actually painting
            the triangle (as opposed to filling it). With the Ti<em>k</em>Z
            frontend all this boils down to a single simple
            <span class="textsc">metafont</span>-like command:
          </p>
          <pre class="verbatim">
\draw (0,0) -- (1,0) -- (1,1) -- cycle;

</pre
          >

          <p>
            In practice, Ti<em>k</em>Z is the only &ldquo;serious&rdquo;
            frontend for <span class="textsc">pgf</span>. It gives you access to
            all features of <span class="textsc">pgf</span>, but it is intended
            to be easy to use. The syntax is a mixture of
            <span class="textsc">metafont</span> and
            <span class="textsc">pstricks</span> and some ideas of myself. There
            are other frontends besides Ti<em>k</em>Z, but they are intended
            more as &ldquo;technology studies&rdquo; and less as serious
            alternatives to Ti<em>k</em>Z. In particular, the
            <span class="texttt">pgfpict2e</span> frontend reimplements the
            standard
            <span class="latexlogofont"
              ><span class="latexlogo"
                >L<span class="latexlogosup">a</span>T<span class="latexlogosub"

            really &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; since the

            a job at reimplementing the
            <span class="texttt">{picture}</span> environment. Rather, the idea
            behind this package is to have a simple demonstration of how a
            frontend can be implemented.

          <p>
            Since most users will only use Ti<em>k</em>Z and almost no one will
            use the system layer directly, this manual is mainly about
            Ti<em>k</em>Z in the first parts; the basic layer and the system
            layer are explained at the end.

              <p>
                1. The standard

                <span class="texttt">{picture}</span> environment allows you to
                create simple graphics, but little more. This is certainly not
                due to a lack of knowledge or imagination on the part of
                <span class="latexlogofont"
                  ><span class="latexlogo"
                    >L<span class="latexlogosup">a</span>T<span

                >&rsquo;s designer(s). Rather, this is the price paid for the
                <span class="texttt">{picture}</span> environment&rsquo;s
                portability: It works together with all backend drivers.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                2. The <span class="texttt">pstricks</span> package is certainly
                powerful enough to create any conceivable kind of graphic, but
                it is not really portable. Most importantly, it does not work
                with <span class="texttt">pdftex</span> nor with any other
                driver that produces anything but PostScript code.
              </p>
              <p>
                Compared to Ti<em>k</em>Z,
                <span class="texttt">pstricks</span> has a similar support base.
                There are many nice extra packages for special purpose
                situations that have been contributed by users over the last
                decade. The Ti<em>k</em>Z syntax is more consistent than the
                <span class="texttt">pstricks</span> syntax as Ti<em>k</em>Z was
                developed &ldquo;in a more centralized manner&rdquo; and also
                &ldquo;with the shortcomings on
                <span class="texttt">pstricks</span> in mind&rdquo;.
              </p>

              <p>
                3. The <span class="texttt">xypic</span> package is an older
                package for creating graphics. However, it is more difficult to
                use and to learn because the syntax and the documentation are a
                bit cryptic.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                4. The <span class="texttt">dratex</span> package is a small
                graphic package for creating a graphics. Compared to the other
                package, including Ti<em>k</em>Z, it is very small, which may or
                may not be an advantage.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                5. The <span class="texttt">metapost</span> program is a
                powerful alternative to Ti<em>k</em>Z. It used to be an external
                program, which entailed a bunch of problems, but in Lua<span
                  class="latexlogofont"
                  ><span class="latexlogo"
                    >T<span class="latexlogosub">e</span>X</span
                  ></span
                >
                it is now built in. An obstacle with
                <span class="texttt">metapost</span> is the inclusion of labels.
                This is <em>much</em> easier to achieve using
                <span class="textsc">pgf</span>.

            <li>
              <p>
                6. The <span class="texttt">xfig</span> program is an important
                alternative to Ti<em>k</em>Z for users who do not wish to
                &ldquo;program&rdquo; their graphics as is necessary with
                Ti<em>k</em>Z and the other packages above. There is a
                conversion program that will convert
                <span class="texttt">xfig</span> graphics to Ti<em>k</em>Z.

            The <span class="textsc">pgf</span> package comes along with a
            number of utility package that are not really about creating
            graphics and which can be used independently of
            <span class="textsc">pgf</span>. However, they are bundled with
            <span class="textsc">pgf</span>, partly out of convenience, partly
            because their functionality is closely intertwined with
            <span class="textsc">pgf</span>. These utility packages are:
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li>
              <p>
                1. The <span class="texttt">pgfkeys</span> package defines a
                powerful key management facility. It can be used completely
                independently of <span class="textsc">pgf</span>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                2. The <span class="texttt">pgffor</span> package defines a
                useful <span class="texttt">\foreach</span> statement.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                3. The <span class="texttt">pgfcalendar</span> package defines
                macros for creating calendars. Typically, these calendars will
                be rendered using <span class="textsc">pgf</span>&rsquo;s
                graphic engine, but you can use
                <span class="texttt">pgfcalendar</span> also typeset calendars
                using normal text. The package also defines commands for
                &ldquo;working&rdquo; with dates.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                4. The <span class="texttt">pgfpages</span> package is used to
                assemble several pages into a single page. It provides commands
                for assembling several &ldquo;virtual pages&rdquo; into a single
                &ldquo;physical page&rdquo;. The idea is that whenever
                <span class="latexlogofont"
                  ><span class="latexlogo"
                    >T<span class="latexlogosub">e</span>X</span
                  ></span
                >
                has a page ready for &ldquo;shipout&rdquo;,
                <span class="texttt">pgfpages</span> interrupts this shipout and
                instead stores the page to be shipped out in a special box. When
                enough &ldquo;virtual pages&rdquo; have been accumulated in this
                way, they are scaled down and arranged on a &ldquo;physical
                page&rdquo;, which then <em>really</em> shipped out. This
                mechanism allows you to create &ldquo;two page on one
                page&rdquo; versions of a document directly inside
                <span class="latexlogofont"
                  ><span class="latexlogo"
                    >L<span class="latexlogosup">a</span>T<span

                    >X</span
                  ></span
                >
                without the use of any external programs. However,
                <span class="texttt">pgfpages</span> can do quite a lot more
                than that. You can use it to put logos and watermark on pages,
                print up to 16 pages on one page, add borders to pages, and
                more.

          <p>
            This manual describes both the design of Ti<em>k</em>Z and its
            usage. The organization is very roughly according to
            &ldquo;user-friendliness&rdquo;. The commands and subpackages that
            are easiest and most frequently used are described first, more
            low-level and esoteric features are discussed later.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you have not yet installed Ti<em>k</em>Z, please read the
            installation first. Second, it might be a good idea to read the
            tutorial. Finally, you might wish to skim through the description of
            Ti<em>k</em>Z. Typically, you will not need to read the sections on
            the basic layer. You will only need to read the part on the system
            layer if you intend to write your own frontend or if you wish to
            port <span class="textsc">pgf</span> to a new driver.

          <p>
            The &ldquo;public&rdquo; commands and environments provided by the
            system are described throughout the text. In each such description,
            the described command, environment or option is printed in red. Text

            <li>
              <p>
                1. Read the manual, at least the part that has to do with your
                problem.
              </p>

            <li>

                GitHub development page for <span class="textsc">pgf</span> and
                Ti<em>k</em>Z (see the title of this document). Perhaps someone

                4. Before you file a bug report, especially a bug report
                concerning the installation, make sure that this is really a
                bug. In particular, have a look at the
                <span class="texttt">.log</span> file that results when you
                <span class="latexlogofont"

                  ></span
                >
                your files. This <span class="texttt">.log</span> file should
                show that all the right files are loaded from the right
                directories. Nearly all installation problems can be resolved by
                looking at the <span class="texttt">.log</span> file.

                5. <em>As a last resort</em> you can try to email me (Till
                Tantau) or, if the problem concerns the mathematical engine,
                Mark Wibrow. I do not mind getting emails, I simply get way too
                many of them. Because of this, I cannot guarantee that your
                emails will be answered in a timely fashion or even at all. Your
                chances that your problem will be fixed are somewhat higher if
                you mail to the <span class="textsc">pgf</span> mailing list
                (naturally, I read this list and answer questions when I have
