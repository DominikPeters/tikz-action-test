          <p>
            The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
            freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the
            <span class="textsc">gnu</span> General Public License is intended
            to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software&mdash;to
            make sure the software is free for all its users. This General
            Public License applies to most of the Free Software
            Foundation&rsquo;s software and to any other program whose authors
            commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
            covered by the <span class="textsc">gnu</span> Library General
            Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
          </p>

          <p>
            When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
            price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
            you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
            charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code
            or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or
            use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do
            these things.
          </p>

          <p>
            To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
            anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
            rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
            you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
            gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
            that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get
            the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know
            their rights.
          </p>

          <p>
            We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
            and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
            copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
          </p>

          <p>
            Also, for each author&rsquo;s protection and ours, we want to make
            certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this
            free software. If the software is modified by someone else and
            passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not
            the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not
            reflect on the original authors&rsquo; reputations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
            patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
            program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making
            the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that
            any patent must be licensed for everyone&rsquo;s free use or not
            licensed at all.
          </p>

          <p>
            The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
            modification follow.

                <span class="listmarker">0.</span> This License applies to any
                program or other work which contains a notice placed by the
                copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
                this General Public License. The &ldquo;Program&rdquo;, below,
                refers to any such program or work, and a &ldquo;work based on
                the Program&rdquo; means either the Program or any derivative
                work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
                Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
                modifications and/or translated into another language.
                (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the
                term &ldquo;modification&rdquo;.) Each licensee is addressed as

              <p>
                Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
                not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act
                of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from
                the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work
                based on the Program (independent of having been made by running
                the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program
                does.

            <li>

                appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright
                notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices
                that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
                and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this

                You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a

                or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you

                    <span class="listmarker">(a)</span> You must cause the

                    to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties

                    <span class="listmarker">(c)</span> If the modified program
                    normally reads commands interactively when run, you must
                    cause it, when started running for such interactive use in
                    the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement
                    including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that
                    there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
                    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
                    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of
                    this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is
                    interactive but does not normally print such an
                    announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
                    to print an announcement.)

                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
                identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
                Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and
                separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,
                do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
                separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as
                part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the
                distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,
                whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
                whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
                it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
                contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
                intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
                derivative or collective works based on the Program.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
                Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program)
                on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
                the other work under the scope of this License.

                    be distributed under the terms of Sections&nbsp;1 and 2

                    corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only
                    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the

                The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work
                for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete
                source code means all the source code for all modules it
                contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus
                the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
                executable. However, as a special exception, the source code
                distributed need not include anything that is normally
                distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
                components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system
                on which the executable runs, unless that component itself
                accompanies the executable.
              </p>
              <p>
                If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
                access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
                access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
                distribution of the source code, even though third parties are
                not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

                a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For
                example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
                redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
                directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could
                satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely
                from distribution of the Program.

                If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable

                It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
                any patents or other property right claims or to contest
                validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose
                of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution
                system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many
                people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
                software distributed through that system in reliance on
                consistent application of that system; it is up to the
                author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
                software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose
                that choice.

                This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is

                If the Program does not specify a version number of this

            It is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your
            own personal use, without also meeting the above conditions for
            distributing the modified component. While you might intend that
            such modifications will never be distributed, often this will happen
            by accident &ndash; you may forget that you have modified that
            component; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access
            the modified version that you are thus distributing it and violating
            the conditions of this license in ways that could have legal
            implications and, worse, cause problems for the community. It is
            therefore usually in your best interest to keep your copy of the
            Work identical with the public one. Many works provide ways to
            control the behavior of that work without altering any of its
            licensed components.

            The <span class="textsc">lppl</span> requires that distributions of

            important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which
            files constitute the Work. This could, for example, be achieved by
            explicitly listing all the files of the Work near the copyright
            notice of each file or by using a line such as:
          </p>
          <pre class="verbatim">
 % This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.

</pre
          >

          <p>
            in that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be
            impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you
            to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be
            entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise
            the Work.

            The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
            functional and useful document &ldquo;free&rdquo; in the sense of
            freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
            redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially
            or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the
            author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
            being considered responsible for modifications made by others.
          </p>

          <p>
            This License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that
            derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same
            sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a
            copyleft license designed for free software.
          </p>

          <p>
            We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
            free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
            free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
            that the software does. But this License is not limited to software
            manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject
            matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend
            this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or
            reference.

          <p>
            This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
            that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
            be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants
            a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use
            that work under the conditions stated herein. The
            <b>&ldquo;Document&rdquo;</b>, below, refers to any such manual or
            work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as
            <b>&ldquo;you&rdquo;</b>. You accept the license if you copy, modify
            or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright
            law.
          </p>

          <p>
            A <b>&ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo;</b> of the Document means any
            work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied
            verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another
            language.
          </p>

          <p>
            A <b>&ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo;</b> is a named appendix or a
            front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
            relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
            Document&rsquo;s overall subject (or to related matters) and
            contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
            subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of
            mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
            The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the
            subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
            philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <b>&ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo;</b> are certain Secondary
            Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant
            Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released
            under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition
            of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
            The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document
            does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <b>&ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo;</b> are certain short passages of
            text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in
            the notice that says that the Document is released under this
            License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover
            Text may be at most 25 words.
          </p>

          <p>
            A <b>&ldquo;Transparent&rdquo;</b> copy of the Document means a
            machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification
            is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising
            the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for
            images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings)
            some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input
            to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
            formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an
            otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
            markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
            modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not
            Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that
            is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called
            <b>&ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;</b>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
            ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
            or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
            simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
            Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
            Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
            edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
            the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
            machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
            processors for output purposes only.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <b>&ldquo;Title Page&rdquo;</b> means, for a printed book, the
            title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold,
            legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title
            page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
            &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means the text near the most prominent
            appearance of the work&rsquo;s title, preceding the beginning of the
            body of the text.
          </p>

          <p>
            A section <b>&ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo;</b> means a named subunit of
            the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in
            parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language.
            (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such
            as <b>&ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;</b>,
            <b>&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;</b>, <b>&ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;</b>,
            or <b>&ldquo;History&rdquo;</b>.) To
            <b>&ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;</b> of such a section when you
            modify the Document means that it remains a section &ldquo;Entitled
            XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
            which states that this License applies to the Document. These
            Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
            this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
            implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
            no effect on the meaning of this License.

            add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may
            not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or
            further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you
            may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a

          <p>
            If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
            printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
            Document&rsquo;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
            enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
            these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
            Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly
            and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front
            cover must present the full title with all words of the title
            equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the
            covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
            long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
            conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
            legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
            reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
            pages.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
            more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
            Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
            each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
            network-using public has access to download using public-standard
            network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
            of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take
            reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
            copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain
            thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after
            the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through
            your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
            the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
            to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
            Document.

            material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
            some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their
            titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
            Version&rsquo;s license notice. These titles must be distinct from
            any other section titles.

            You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided
            it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
            various parties&ndash;for example, statements of peer review or that
            the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
            definition of a standard.
          </p>

          <p>
            You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and
            a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the
            list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
            Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
            through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document
            already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
            by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
            behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one,
            on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the
            old one.

            this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
            modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all

            Disclaimers.
          </p>

          <p>
            The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
            multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
            copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
            but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
            by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
            author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique
            number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list
            of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
            &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the various original documents, forming one

            individual works permit. When the Document is included in an

            Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
            distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
            4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
            permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
            translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
            original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
            translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
            Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
            include the original English version of this License and the
            original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a
            disagreement between the translation and the original version of
            this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
            prevail.

            To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy

              section entitled &ldquo;GNU Free Documentation License&rdquo;.
            </p>

          <p>
            If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
